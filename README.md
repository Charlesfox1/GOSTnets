# GOSTnets
This is a high-level python wrapper for Networkx, OSMNX and other network analysis libaries. It aims to make basic network analysis easier for those familiar with GeoPandas. 

Typical tasks include: calculation of OD matrices, occlusion based on raster values / polygon intersection, and ETL from Networkx objects to GeoPandas objects. 

The content of this library is almost entirely based on work done by Geoff Boeing, Kuan Butts and other pioneers in network analysis - thank go to them for writing such beautiful and easily adapted code.
